# About Project
This is my final project for Basic Programming Class as a Computer Engineering student at Universitas Indonesia.
I was responsible for the reservation function (non-API) and some other functions.
Focus here is to strengthen our algorithmic way of thinking so the program may be inefficient.

# Credits

- Althaf Nafi Anwar
- Ivan Indrastata Ramadhan
- Najwa Fathiadisa
- Satya Ananda Sulistio (Me)
